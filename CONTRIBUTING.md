* Class member variables are located at the bottom of the file.
* Tabs are preferred over spaces.
* Avoid aligning variable names and values using tabulations.
* Scope blocks should start on a new line.
* Comment your functions, enums, classes, methods ([Javadoc style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc))
